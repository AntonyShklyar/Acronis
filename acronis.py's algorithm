The algorithm of the acronis.py script:
1. check for the presence of the acronis.log log file. If not, create a file. File size check. If the size equal to 1 GB is reached, the file is cleared;
2. formation of a list of IP addresses of Acronis servers depending on the segment and number of the data center where the server with the Acronis agent is located.
3. definition of the "main" Acronis server (the Acronis server that is located in the same segment and data center as the server with the Acronis agent). Move the IP address of this server to the top of the list.
4. checking network availability via ICMP protocol of Acronis servers;
5. Determine the IP address of the Acronis server to which the Acronis agent is currently connected.
6. switching the Acronis agent to another Acronis server in the cases described below. Formation of the corresponding event.
7. In other cases described below, the Acronis agent is not switched. Formation of the corresponding event.

Cases in which a Acronis agent switches to another Acronis server:
1. if the "main" server is not available and the Acronis agent is connected to it
2. if the "main" server is unavailable and the Acronis agent is not connected to it, but the Acronis agent is connected to another Acronis server that is also unavailable
3. if the "main" server is available, but the Acronis agent is connected to another server

Cases in which a Acronis agent does not switch to another Acronis server:
1. if the "main" server is available and the Acronis agent is connected to it
2. if the "main" server is unavailable, but the Acronis agent is already connected to another available Acronis server
3. an error occurred when switching the Acronis agent.
